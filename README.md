## Do fewer things during the travel, make the travel easier!

This is my first message bot which is used in giving travel spots information of Seoul, and its bases on a communication platform called LINE. The purpose of developing is I don't want to check all the information by opening webs and webs every time before going to the next place, like the business hour of shops, the nearest MRT station, etc. In short, it's personal use for now.

## Stage

It's in the stage of development for now, so the functions there were not be completed yet.

## Usage

### Avalible languages
Tranditional Chinese (zh-TW)

### Basic use

#### Check content
- type "目錄", and it shows all the types of travel spots.

#### Seek information of travel spot
- type keywords like "換錢".
